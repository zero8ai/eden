/**
 * Publish-a-change runner (issue #142). The deployments route used to call `publishDrafts`
 * synchronously inside the HTTP request — an orphan check plus a per-member Docker build gate plus
 * a GitHub PR — which could take a minute. It now runs on the durable job queue: the route enqueues
 * a `publish_change` job, the worker calls this, and it streams progress into the workspace task the
 * indicator shows.
 *
 * Error policy: `publishDrafts` throws for BOTH gate failures (orphan gate, build gate — the user's
 * change simply isn't publishable yet; the drafts stay staged for a fix) AND ordinary GitHub
 * failures. We treat ALL of them as the task's OUTCOME: fail the task, do NOT rethrow, let the job
 * complete. A gate failure is user-actionable, not a queue error, and re-running the merge/publish
 * after a transient hiccup is the user's call (jobs run maxAttempts:1). Only failures from loading
 * the project/task themselves rethrow, since those are genuine infrastructure errors.
