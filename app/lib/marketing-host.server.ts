/**
 * Marketing/app host split (FOH PRD §2.6, D11). `MARKETING_HOST` (a bare host such as
 * `www.eden.example.com`, optionally `host:port` for local dev) puts the editorial marketing
 * site on its own host: the marketing paths serve ONLY there, every other GET on that host
 * redirects to the app origin (`BETTER_AUTH_URL`), and the app host bounces the
 * marketing-only paths to the marketing origin. Unset — the self-host default — everything
 * is a no-op: `/` is Front of House and the marketing pages stay reachable by path.
 *
 * All env reads happen at request time (never at module load) so the dev tunnel's
 * per-process `BETTER_AUTH_URL` override and inline `MARKETING_HOST=… npm run dev` runs
 * behave. Host comparison uses `new URL(request.url).host`, which is trustworthy in prod
 * (nginx forwards `Host $host`; Express runs `trust proxy: loopback`) and in dev (the
 * request hits the dev server directly).
