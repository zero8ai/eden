/**
 * The authoritative pre-merge build gate for assistant conversation branches (issue #137).
 *
 * A conversation branch merges its tree exactly as-is, so the gate compiles every eve project
 * the change touches — mirroring the PUBLISH gate's per-root loop in `app/drafts/drafts.server.ts`
 * (`inferBuildRoots` + the sequential `publishDrafts` build loop). The two must not drift: both
 * collect the member roots a change spans and build each one, scoping a failure to the member.
 *
 * The bug this fixes: the old gate inferred ONE root client-side and, on any multi-member or
 * root-touching change, fell back to building the repo root — which on a team-layout repo is a
 * workspaces shell (no eve project), so a change that built fine per-member failed the gate with
 * an opaque "Could not resolve an eve agent root" error. The roots are now recomputed SERVER-side
 * from the PR's changed files, and a team repo's shared/root files map to no build at all.
