/**
 * Per-host robots.txt (host split, D11 — replaces the static /public file, whose bytes were
 * identical on every host). Three modes:
 *
 *  - MARKETING_HOST unset (self-host default): the single host serves both surfaces, so keep
 *    the marketing policy — case studies stay crawlable, app paths stay out of the index —
 *    with the sitemap on this host's own origin.
 *  - Marketing host: the marketing policy, sitemap on the marketing origin.
 *  - App host with a marketing host configured: nothing here is indexable (every app page
 *    already carries noindex meta) — disallow everything.
