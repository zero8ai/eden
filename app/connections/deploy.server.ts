/**
 * Deploy-side connection injection (issues #30, #163, #167). Turns an agent's active OAuth grants
 * into the env the shipped eve connections need at runtime, per registered provider and per the
 * provider's `credentialDelivery`:
 *
 *  - "refresh-token" (default; google unchanged): the operator client creds plus the sealed
 *    refresh token (unsealed here) as `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` / `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
 *    / `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_REFRESH_TOKEN` — no per-turn control-plane dependency: once these vars are
 *    in the container, eve's `getToken` exchanges the refresh token for access tokens on its own.
 *  - "access-token-broker" (issue #167): the refresh token NEVER ships — rotating-grant providers
 *    (mayi) revoke the whole token family if two writers race a rotation, so Eden stays the
 *    single writer and the instance fetches short-lived access tokens from the control-plane
 *    broker (`POST <EDEN_API_URL>/api/connections/token`, see broker.server.ts). Deploy injects
 *    only `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_SCOPES` plus the provider's static `deployEnv` constants; the broker
 *    coordinates (EDEN_API_URL / EDEN_TEAM_TOKEN) are deployment-scoped and injected by the
 *    controller.
 *  - "capability" (issue #166): the instance gets NO `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_*` vars at all — suppressing
 *    injection is precisely the point: Eden executes the provider's whitelisted operations itself
 *    (`POST <EDEN_API_URL>/api/capabilities/...`). Deploy still VALIDATES the grant (one
 *    rotation-safe liveness refresh, plus the capability's resource binding when it declares one)
 *    so a dead Xero connection fails the deploy with the existing readable reconnect message
 *    rather than failing at first call. The provider id joins the Eden-owned
 *    `EDEN_CAPABILITY_PROVIDERS` marker (comma-joined), which tells the controller to inject the
 *    EDEN_API_URL / EDEN_TEAM_TOKEN coordinates the per-operation tools ride on.
 *
 * The first two deliveries also inject `<PREFIX>_OAUTH_SCOPES` — the grant's GRANTED scopes
 * (issue #165) so agent code can read its actual permission level. Capability providers don't:
 * the agent's permission surface is the operation-group enablement, checked per call in Eden.
 *
 * Each grant is VALIDATED once at deploy by attempting a refresh: a dead grant (invalid_grant) is
 * marked "expired" and the deploy fails honestly with a reconnect message, rather than shipping a
 * container that can never authenticate. A transient refresh failure throws too (deploys should be
 * repeatable), but leaves the grant active. When the provider ROTATES refresh tokens (issue #167),
 * the rotated token from the validation refresh is persisted back onto the grant before anything
 * uses it — otherwise the deploy itself would burn the stored token and the provider's
 * family-reuse detection would kill the grant. The read→refresh→rotate section runs on the SAME
 * per-grant serialization chain as the token broker (refresh-serialization.server.ts): a deployed
 * instance requesting a broker token while a redeploy validates the same grant must queue behind
 * the validation (and vice versa), or both would consume one stored token and the reuse would
 * revoke the family.
 *
 * Per-grant OAuth clients (issue #167): a grant carrying a `clientId` (dynamic registration at
 * connect time) refreshes against ITS OWN client — no operator config involved; operator-level
 * grants keep using `getProviderOAuthConfig` exactly as before.
 *
 * When the caller supplies the installed connectors' required scopes (issue #69), it ALSO validates
 * scope COVERAGE per provider: an active grant whose granted scopes don't cover what the installs
 * require would 403 at runtime, so the deploy fails honestly with a "reconnect" message instead.
 * The grant stays active (it isn't dead — just under-scoped), so it is NOT marked expired.
 *
 * The persistence + config touchpoints are injectable (`ConnectionDeployDeps`) so the decision
 * logic is unit-testable with fakes; the default wiring hits Postgres + operator env.
