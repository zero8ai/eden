/**
 * Operator config for Eden's ONE shared Discord app (issue #32). A self-host installation
 * registers a single Discord application in the Developer Portal and sets its three
 * credentials as control-plane env. The connect flow, the interactions relay, and the send
 * proxy all read this — the bot token NEVER leaves the control plane (it can act in every
 * connected server across all tenants), only the public credentials reach agent instances.
 *
 * Null unless all three are present: a partial config can't drive any Discord operation, and
 * treating it as "unconfigured" keeps legacy self-managed-app users untouched at deploy time.
