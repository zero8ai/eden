/**
 * Discord interactions relay (issue #32) — the single Interactions Endpoint URL of Eden's
 * shared app. Discord POSTs every interaction here; the control plane verifies the Ed25519
 * signature, answers the endpoint-validation PING itself (no guild is connected at setup time),
 * and otherwise forwards the RAW request (body + signature headers untouched) to the bound
 * agent instance's eve Discord channel, which re-verifies and replies with the interaction
 * token. Command starts are indexed before that raw forward; the bot token never leaves the
 * control plane. Resource route (action only).
