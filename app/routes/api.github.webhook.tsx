/**
 * GitHub App webhook receiver — keeps Eden's Release history in sync when a change is merged
 * on github.com instead of in-app (PRD §7.3: "merge in Eden or on GitHub").
 *
 * On a PR merged into the default branch, find-or-create the Release at the merge commit. It
 * does NOT auto-deploy: deploying a version is a separate, explicit act on the Deployments tab
 * (the human picks environment + traffic weight — the multi-version primitive, §7.7). The
 * release create is idempotent with the in-app Merge button via `ensureReleaseForCommit`, so a
 * change merged in Eden and echoed back by this webhook yields exactly one Release.
 * Resource route (action only); signature-verified.
