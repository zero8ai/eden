/**
 * Roster-change teammate refresh (Team delegation — D7). `EDEN_TEAMMATES` is deploy-time env, so
 * adding or removing a member must refresh the OTHER members' running instances — otherwise a new
 * teammate never appears in their tool, and a removed one lingers. After a merge-driven roster
 * sync changes membership, this queues a same-release redeploy (image reuse — no rebuild) of every
 * live member deployment; each redeploy re-mints `EDEN_TEAMMATES` from the current roster.
 *
 * Trigger discipline (D7): called ONLY from the merge webhook — the merge-driven sync point that
 * also covers in-app ship (which merges via GitHub). NEVER from the loader self-heal path
 * (`resolveSyncedAgentContext` also syncs the roster, and a page load must not deploy anything).
