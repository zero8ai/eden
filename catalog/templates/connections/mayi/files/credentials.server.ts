/**
 * Eden credential binding for brokered connections (issue #167).
 *
 * May I? rotates its OAuth refresh token on every refresh and revokes the whole token family if
 * an old one is reused — so this instance NEVER holds the refresh token. Eden owns the grant,
 * refreshes it centrally, and this binding fetches short-lived access tokens from Eden's token
 * broker (`POST <EDEN_API_URL>/api/connections/token`), authenticated by the deployment's own
 * `EDEN_TEAM_TOKEN`. Both env vars are injected by Eden at deploy; nothing here is a secret an
 * author manages.
 *
 * Tokens are cached until shortly before `expiresAt` (with in-flight dedupe), so broker traffic
 * is about one request per token lifetime — roughly hourly — not per approval.
