/**
 * Environment lifecycle — TEAM-scoped (the team is the deployment unit).
 *
 * Physical vs. logical split: the `environments` table stays PER-AGENT (one row per member per
 * env name, `environments_agent_name_uq` on (agentId, name)). Those row ids are load-bearing —
 * deployments.environmentId, secret scoping, playground_sessions.environmentId/worldKey,
 * delegations, the `/e/<envId>` ingress URLs, and splitter routing all FK to them, so we never
 * collapse them into one row. But LOGICALLY an environment is a team-level thing: a project owns
 * ONE set of environment NAMES, and every roster member (kind === 'member') has a row of every
 * name. A member existing in one env but not another is definitionally drift, not a feature.
 *
 * So env CRUD is fan-out over the roster: create/rename/delete a NAME touches every member's row
 * of that name at once. This eliminates version skew inside an environment (rename member A and
 * deploy only A, and B's ask-a-teammate tool still points at the old name → broken). The team
 * env set S is the distinct env names across the project's member agents.
 *
 * The built-in assistant agent (kind === 'assistant') is EXEMPT — it is never part of S, never a
 * fan-out target, and keeps its own `ensureDefault` seeding in the assistant instance path.
 *
 * Delete is the loaded one: the row cascade removes the env's deployments (and schedules) plus
 * env-scoped secrets, but rows can't stop docker containers or drop the environment's Workflow
 * world DB — so per member row we tear infra down FIRST via the DeployTarget (`destroy` when it
 * has it, `stop` otherwise) per deployment, then `destroyWorld` once for the environment, all
 * best-effort.
