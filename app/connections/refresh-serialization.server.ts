/**
 * Per-grant refresh serialization (issue #167). Rotating-grant providers (mayi) revoke the whole
 * token family when a stored refresh token is consumed twice, so EVERY control-plane refresh of a
 * grant — broker calls (broker.server.ts) AND deploy-time validation (deploy.server.ts) — must run
 * on ONE in-process chain per grant scope: each task re-reads the grant row inside the chain, so a
 * queued task always consumes its predecessor's rotated token, never the same stored one. The two
 * callers share this module precisely so a broker call racing a redeploy's validation refresh
 * cannot double-spend a token. Cross-process writes (not a shape the single-container control
 * plane produces) are detected after the fact by the compare-and-set in
 * `rotateGrantRefreshToken` and surface as a retryable error.
