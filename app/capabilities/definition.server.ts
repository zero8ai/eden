/**
 * Capability definitions (issue #166) — the brokered-capability framework's contract.
 *
 * A capability generalizes the Discord send proxy (issue #32): Eden holds the vendor credential
 * (an ordinary brokered OAuth grant, issue #163) and exposes a FIXED registry of whitelisted
 * operations per provider. The credential is NEVER injected into an agent's instance
 * (`credentialDelivery: "capability"` on the provider entry); the agent's thin tools POST to
 * `POST /api/capabilities/:provider/:operation` with their `EDEN_TEAM_TOKEN`, and the control
 * plane validates the request server-side and performs the one blessed operation itself.
 * Anything not in a definition does not exist — there is no passthrough.
 *
 * Definitions are CODE (validation logic can't be data): one module per provider, registered in
 * `registry.server.ts`. `.server.ts` throughout — `execute` reaches vendor APIs and `resource`
 * lists provider-side bindings with a live access token.
