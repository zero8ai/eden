/**
 * Cross-redeploy conversation seed (#71).
 *
 * When a playground follow-up lands on a deployment that did NOT create the conversation's eve
 * session (the owning container was replaced, or a different deployment was explicitly selected),
 * the eve-side runtime context is gone — it died with the old container and can't be migrated. So
 * instead of dead-ending the user, Eden seeds a FRESH eve session on the replacement deployment
 * from its own durable transcript cache (`playground_events`): the prior conversation is rendered
 * into a plain-text block and prepended to the first message on the new session, so the agent
 * continues with the history in context.
 *
 * That block must be invisible to the human transcript. It rides inside the durable
 * `message.received` event (same as the model directive), so it is wrapped in strippable
 * HTML-comment markers and removed on replay — see `stripSeedContext`, called alongside
 * `stripModelDirective` in `projectEventsToEntries`.
