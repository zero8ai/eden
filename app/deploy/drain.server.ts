/**
 * Blue-green drain of a superseded deployment (issue #81).
 *
 * A redeploy stands the new container up alongside the old and — at cutover (controller.server.ts)
 * — flips the old row to `draining`. That single status change does two things without any routing
 * code: it removes the row from every `status === "live"` query (splitter, Discord relay, playground,
 * team ask), so all NEW inbound work goes to the new container immediately; and it closes
 * `ingestRunStart`'s run-start gate, so no new `running` run row can attach to the old deployment.
 *
 * The old container keeps running only to FINISH in-flight turns (a turn legitimately runs 15+
 * minutes; reply delivery is outbound and needs no inbound traffic). This watcher polls the runs
 * table and stops the container once it shows no `running` rows — or once a hard drain ceiling
 * passes, at which point any still-running turn is killed VISIBLY (marked `failed` with an
 * interruption error in Runs) rather than force-killed silently on a 5s docker timeout.
 *
 * Mirrors cleanup.server.ts's shape: a deps interface with a `getRuntime()` default, a re-check at
 * execution time (scheduling is never proof), and a result union. Shares the DeployTarget stop
 * helper with the controller (moved here so the import direction stays acyclic: controller → drain).
