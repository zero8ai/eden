 * Revalidate the current route's loader on an interval so screens that display

 *
 * Crucially the baseline poll is NOT gated on the initial in-flight state: a
 * deploy that STARTS after the page has loaded — a quick deploy, a teammate's
 * deploy, a Discord/GitHub-triggered one — is still picked up, and the in-flight
 * state clearing at the tail end can't be missed either (issue #41). Pass
 * `active` to speed the cadence up while a deploy is known to be in progress.
 *
 * Polling pauses while the tab is hidden, since a background tab can't show the
 * update anyway — it revalidates once on the next tick after it regains focus.
