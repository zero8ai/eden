/**
 * Parse the playground composer's model/effort form fields into a validated selection.
 *
 * Effort only means anything attached to a model selection — the signed directive embeds it
 * next to the model id, and a deployed fallback already carries its own effort. An effort sent
 * without a model (older clients echo the agent's default effort) is therefore dropped, not
 * rejected: rejecting it broke every send from a playground whose agent had a saved effort.
