/**
 * Ship — the one-click deploy pipeline (quick path over the existing rails, PRD §7.3/§7.7).
 *
 * The TEAM is the deployment unit: a ship always moves the WHOLE roster into one environment,
 * never a subset. Cross-agent coupling makes partial deploys unsafe — the ask-a-teammate tool
 * references sibling names/coordinates, renames ripple across members, and shared files rebuild
 * everyone — so "which agent" is never a question a user answers; only "which environment" is.
 *
 * shipStagedChanges chains what the Changes + Deployments pages do manually: publish ALL staged
 * drafts as one change request, merge it immediately, cut Releases at the merge commit (one per
 * roster member, via the same idempotent path the GitHub webhook uses), and queue a deploy into
 * every member's env of the chosen name. The publish build-gate still applies: a change-set that
 * doesn't compile creates nothing and the drafts stay staged.
 *
 * deployTeamVersion is the version-history counterpart: move the whole team to an existing
 * version (by git sha) in an environment — the rollback/redeploy path, direction-neutral.
 *
 * Everything is deps-injectable in the publishDrafts style so unit tests run with zero I/O.
