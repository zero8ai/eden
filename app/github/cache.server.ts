/**
 * In-memory stale-while-revalidate cache for GitHub reads (M5.9).
 *
 * Every GitHub REST call costs ~600ms from this machine (Australia), and a single navigation
 * chains several — so uncached loaders sat at 2–3s. This cache lets a loader return the last
 * known value instantly and refresh it in the background, turning repeat navigations into a
 * memory hit. Entries are keyed per connected repo (owner/repo + ref), so growth is bounded by
 * the number of connected repos in practice — there is no eviction (unbounded by design at this
 * scale; a process restart clears it, and invalidation drops stale keys on writes/webhooks).
 *
 * Staleness is checked lazily on access — no timers. Concurrent reads for one key share a single
 * in-flight fetch (both on a cold miss and a background revalidation), so one key never triggers
 * two GitHub calls at once. The instance is stashed on `globalThis` to survive dev HMR (same
 * pattern as the Drizzle client, db/client.server.ts).
