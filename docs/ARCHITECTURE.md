# Eden — Managed Service Architecture

> Companion to [`PRD.md`](./PRD.md). Covers the **commercial managed offering**: how Eden runs,
> isolates, meters, and bills customer eve agents on infrastructure Eden owns.

## 1. First principles (substrate-independent)

These hold no matter what we run on — a cloud provider, a Kubernetes cluster, or a single bare-metal
box. They are what keep the managed service and the OSS product **one codebase**.

1. **Control plane vs. data plane are separate.**
   - _Control plane_ = the Eden web app + APIs (GitHub, authoring, PRs, deploy controller,
     scheduler, model gateway, metering, billing, tenancy). It **never runs customer agent code**.
   - _Data plane_ = the fleet of running eve instances. In managed mode Eden owns it.

2. **The tenancy unit is one isolated instance per deployed agent — not per customer.**
   In eve, a tool's `execute()` runs **in the host Nitro process** (only `bash`/model-generated code
   goes to the sandbox). Customer-authored tools are arbitrary TypeScript, so the host process runs
   untrusted per-customer code. Tenants therefore **cannot share a process or, ideally, a kernel**.

3. **Two isolation layers:**
   - _Instance boundary_ — isolates customer A's tool code from customer B (tenant trust boundary).
   - _Sandbox boundary_ — isolates model-generated code from the instance it runs in.

4. **Compute ⟂ state (this is the money-saver).** eve sessions are durable via the Workflow SDK; a
   parked agent (waiting on a message, an approval, or a cron) consumes **zero compute**. The durable
   event log lives in **Postgres**, fully decoupled from the compute. So idle instances can be
   **stopped**, and on the next event they **replay from Postgres and resume**. Most agents are idle
   almost always → density comes from packing _stopped_ instances, and cost is driven by _concurrent
   active_ turns, not total agents.

5. **Managed = OSS + provider implementations.** Everything below hangs off interfaces the OSS
   product already defines: `DeployTarget`, `SecretsProvider`, `ModelGateway`, `MeteringSink`,
   `Scheduler`. OSS ships local/no-op/BYO versions; managed ships the real ones. **No fork.**

## 2. The substrate: one bare-metal box, many Docker containers

**Decision:** v1 managed runs on a **single dedicated bare-metal server** (target ~$200–1,000/mo
class, e.g. a 48+ core / 256 GB Hetzner-style dedicated box), packing **many Docker containers** —
one per deployed agent instance, plus sandboxes and control-plane services. We explicitly **avoid**
per-VM cloud platforms (Fly/Firecracker-as-a-service) for cost reasons. Bare metal is chosen
deliberately: it exposes **KVM**, so we can still get microVM-grade isolation _ourselves_ when we
want it (§2.2) — something most cloud VPS products forbid (no nested virt).

### 2.1 Orchestration on the box

| Option                                                                    | Verdict                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nomad** (single static binary, Docker driver, gVisor/Kata task drivers) | **Recommended.** Runs great on one node, gives scheduling/placement/health/restart for free, and makes the eventual **1→N box** jump trivial (add a node, it schedules across them). Low ops overhead vs. K8s. |
| **Plain Docker Engine API** (deploy controller calls the daemon directly) | Fine **fallback / M-first**: zero extra moving parts. Start here if Nomad is friction; migrate to Nomad when we outgrow one box.                                                                               |
| **K3s / Kubernetes**                                                      | Overkill for one box; adopt only if we standardize on K8s later. Behind the same `DeployTarget` seam regardless.                                                                                               |

The **deploy controller** (control plane) is the only thing that talks to the orchestrator. It's an
implementation of `DeployTarget` — `BareMetalDockerTarget` (or `NomadTarget`).

### 2.2 Isolation — the part that matters on a shared kernel

Plain Docker shares the host kernel; that is **too weak** for untrusted model-generated code. On bare
metal we have the full menu:

| Layer                                        | v1                                                                                            | Hardening upgrade                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance container** (customer tool code)  | **gVisor (`runsc`)** runtime — userspace-kernel syscall isolation, high density, low overhead | Kata if a tenant needs VM-grade isolation                                                                      |
| **Sandbox** (model-generated `bash`/scripts) | **gVisor**, or a dedicated ephemeral sandbox container per exec                               | **Kata / Firecracker via `firecracker-containerd`** — real microVMs, available because bare metal gives us KVM |

v1 pragmatic default: **gVisor for both layers**, sandbox containers are **ephemeral** (created per
exec/session, destroyed after). Upgrade the sandbox layer to Firecracker microVMs once we're handling
genuinely hostile workloads. This is a config choice at the runtime level, not an architecture change.

### 2.3 Scale-to-zero + wake-on-request (without a cloud)

We reproduce Fly's "sleep when idle, wake on request" on our own box:

- **Sleep:** the deploy controller / scheduler **stops** (not removes) an instance container after an
  idle timeout. A stopped container uses **0 CPU, 0 RAM** — only disk (image layers + its writable
  layer). State is safe because the Workflow event log is in Postgres, not the container.
- **Wake-on-request:** an on-demand reverse proxy starts the stopped container on the next inbound
  request, then forwards once healthy. **[Sablier](https://github.com/sablierapp/sablier)** does
  exactly this with Traefik/Caddy/nginx; or we build a thin wake-proxy. First request after sleep
  eats a cold-start (~container start + Nitro boot + Workflow replay); subsequent requests are warm.
- **Scheduled wake:** a sleeping instance can't fire its own cron, so the **control-plane scheduler**
  (§3.3) wakes the container at the scheduled time to run the turn, then lets it idle back to sleep.

### 2.4 Density / capacity model (why one box goes far)

- **Idle (stopped) instance:** ~0 CPU/RAM; cost = disk for image + writable layer. Thousands fit.
- **Active turn:** a burst of CPU + a few hundred MB RAM for the Node/Nitro process (+ sandbox when
  code runs). Concurrency is bounded by **active** turns, not total agents.
- **Back-of-envelope:** 256 GB box, ~512 MB per active instance ⇒ ~**500 concurrent active turns**;
  total _hosted_ agents in the thousands because the idle ones are stopped. Disk (images + Postgres +
  layers) becomes the first real ceiling — mitigate with a shared base image and layer dedup.

---

## 3. Control-plane components

Same box (as containers) for v1; logically the control plane, and separable onto its own host later.

### 3.1 Deploy controller (`DeployTarget`)

Runs the pipeline on merge: `eve build` → package image → push to a **local registry** on the box →
provision the instance's Postgres DB + secrets → `docker run` (via Nomad/Docker API) with the chosen
gVisor/Kata runtime → wire ingress → health-check. Handles rollback (previous image tag) and
stop/start for scale-to-zero.

### 3.2 Model gateway (keys · metering · caps)

Off-Vercel there is no AI Gateway, so we run our **own proxy** (LiteLLM-class or a thin service) that
every instance's model calls route through. It is the single place where we:

- **own provider keys** (customers never see them),
- **meter tokens** per instance (metering chokepoint #1),
- **enforce per-tenant spend caps / rate limits** and kill-switches.

### 3.3 Scheduler

Owns all cron/`schedules` for managed instances. Fires at the scheduled time, **wakes** the target
instance (§2.3), triggers the turn. Central because sleeping instances can't self-fire. Durable (backed
by the control-plane DB / a queue) so a box reboot doesn't drop schedules.

### 3.4 Metering + billing

Three capture chokepoints → metering store → Stripe:

- **Model tokens** — from the model gateway (§3.2).
- **Compute-seconds** — from the orchestrator / cgroup accounting (`docker stats` / Nomad metrics)
  per instance.
- **Sandbox execution** — from the sandbox runtime (exec count / duration).
  Events land in Postgres (ClickHouse only if volume demands), aggregate into usage, push **Stripe
  usage records**. Plans + usage-based billing on top. We pay the box + model providers, mark up.

### 3.5 Secrets

KMS-backed (or Vault) secret store; encrypted at rest; injected as **container env at start**; scoped
per instance/environment; **never written to the repo**. The authoring assistant references secrets by
name only.

### 3.6 Ingress / routing

A reverse proxy (**Caddy or Traefik**) on the box with **wildcard TLS** (`*.eden.app`), routing
`agent-<id>.eden.app` → the instance container, integrated with the wake-proxy (§2.3). Also terminates
channel webhooks (Slack/HTTP) per instance. **Discord (issue #32)** is the exception: one
Eden-owned Discord app serves the whole installation, so its single Interactions Endpoint URL
points at the **control plane** (`/api/discord/interactions`), which verifies the signature and
relays each interaction to the bound agent instance's Discord channel — the shared bot token
never reaches an instance.

**Version-aware traffic splitting (§3.9, PRD §7.7 — data plane only since M5.6).** The data model
admits **multiple Releases live at once** in one environment; the proxy does **weighted,
session-sticky** routing across their instance containers: a weight per Release (e.g. 90/10 canary
or 50/50) and a **session pin** (cookie / `x-eve-session-id` / channel thread id) so a conversation
stays on one version for its whole life — you cannot flip an agent mid-turn. Wake-on-request
composes with this (each Release's container sleeps / wakes independently). Runs are version-tagged
(§3.7), so per-version telemetry comparison is free. **Product model since M5.6:** the deploy
controller enforces a single live Release per environment (a deploy that lands healthy demotes the
rest), so the splitter trivially routes to one instance until a multi-version surface returns.

### 3.7 Observability / run-observability subsystem

First-class subsystem (PRD pillar §7.6), not an afterthought — teams must be able to open any agent
and inspect any execution in full. Vercel's Agent Runs is Vercel-only, so Eden ships its own on
**every** deploy target.

**Two ingestion sources (complementary):**

- **eve OpenTelemetry** — `agent/instrumentation.ts` emits AI-SDK spans (tokens, model, latency,
  model/tool I/O). Instances export **OTLP** to an Eden **collector**.
- **Workflow event log** — the durable, replayable per-turn/per-step record in the instance's
  Postgres World. Read by an event-log reader for structure + durability (survives, replayable).
  Eden merges both into a normalized **runs store**.

**Ingestion path differs by mode (important):**

- **Managed:** instance and collector are co-located on the box; OTLP is local, cheap.
- **BYO / self-host:** the instance runs in the _customer's_ account, so it must **ship telemetry to
  Eden's collector over an authenticated OTLP endpoint** (per-instance ingest token). This is the one
  genuinely new architectural surface observability adds — a public, authenticated OTLP receiver +
  per-instance credentials.

**Runs store & data model** (Postgres now; **ClickHouse** if span/event volume demands):

```
Session(id, agent_id, tenant/org_id, trigger, started_at, ...)
  └─ Run(id, session_id, agent_version=git_sha/build_id, trigger_source,
         started_at, ended_at, wall_ms, status, error, tokens_in, tokens_out, cost,
         model(s), tool_call_count, tool_error_count)
       └─ Step(id, run_id, seq, type[model_call|tool_call|reasoning|message],
               started_at, ended_at, duration_ms,
               // model_call: messages_in, output, tokens, model
               // tool_call:  tool_name, input, output, error, approval_gated
               ...)
```

- **System prompt = link, not (only) snapshot.** Each Run stores the **deployed `git_sha`/build id**;
  Eden reconstructs the exact system prompt (`instructions.md` + tools + skills) from the repo at that
  commit. Optional resolved-prompt snapshot for immutability. **User input, tool I/O, tokens, timing
  are runtime data and are always recorded.**
- **UI:** _Agent → Run list_ (summary metrics) → _Run transcript_ (progressive-disclosure timeline).

**Cross-cutting:**

- **Access control** requires an active Better Auth organization membership — transcripts hold
  sensitive prompt/response data.
- **Tenant isolation** of telemetry in managed mode (org-scoped store + queries).
- **Retention + redaction** policies; deployer-disclosure note per eve guidance.
- **Relationship to metering (§3.4):** the model gateway remains the **billing** source of truth for
  tokens; observability is the **per-run detail** view. Reconcile, don't double-count.

### 3.8 Tenancy & auth (Better Auth)

Authentication is self-hosted with **Better Auth** and its React Router handler at `/api/auth/*`.
Eden enables email/password authentication and the Better Auth organization plugin; the same
Postgres database holds the canonical `user`, `session`, `account`, `verification`, `organization`,
`member`, and `invitation` records. There is no hosted auth dashboard or external OAuth callback in
this flow. Signup auto-signs in after name/email/password and does not require email verification.
Password reset uses Better Auth's one-hour verification token, revokes that user's existing
sessions on success, and never exposes whether a reset-request email is registered. Organization
invitation acceptance is deliberately stricter: the plugin's
`requireEmailVerificationOnInvitation` gate requires the recipient to verify the invited mailbox
before invitation details can be read or accepted, while ordinary signup/sign-in remain ungated.
The supported nginx proxy overwrites `X-Real-IP`; Better Auth reads only that trusted single-value
header for its production rate limiter rather than accepting a client-controlled forwarded chain.
The production host uses React Router's official Express adapter with a query-free, capability-ID
redacting request logger. nginx uses the same policy and suppresses raw request-target error logs,
so password-reset, email-verification, and invitation credentials are not persisted in container or
proxy logs.

- **A Better Auth organization = an Eden tenant/workspace.** Eden uses the plugin's APIs for
  organization creation, membership, invitations, roles, and the active organization rather than
  maintaining parallel identity tables.
- The plugin's standard `owner`, `admin`, and `member` roles govern organization-management
  operations. Eden's project surfaces require membership in the active organization; they do not
  bypass the plugin by writing membership or invitation rows directly.
- Eden's application tables hold operational data such as projects, spend limits, deployment and
  billing metadata, and audit entries, keyed by Better Auth organization/user IDs.
- Password resets, invitation delivery, and invitation-recipient verification use React Email
  templates and Postmark
  (`POSTMARK_SERVER_TOKEN` / `FROM_EMAIL`) in production. Development can use `SMTP_URL` for local
  capture. Invitation emails link to `/accept-invitation/:id`; after authentication and mailbox
  verification, that page accepts through the plugin API.
- This implementation is email/password plus organizations. It does not claim SSO, SCIM/directory
  sync, or an external identity audit service.
- Instance-level agent auth (channel route-auth secrets) remains separate and lives in the secrets
  store (§3.5).

**Shared workspaces (issue #56).** The first authenticated request provisions a personal
organization; Better Auth creates the creator membership and stores the active organization on the
session. Invited users join through the plugin's invitation acceptance flow, and organization
administration is limited by the plugin's default roles.

- **Workspace resolution** (session with no valid active organization → `ensureWorkspace`): no
  memberships provisions a personal organization; exactly one membership activates it; several
  memberships send the user to `/workspaces`. A stale active organization is cleared after its
  membership is revalidated.
- **Switching workspaces** calls Better Auth's `setActiveOrganization`, which validates membership,
  without signing the user out. The active workspace is `session.activeOrganizationId`, never a URL
  segment.
- **Cross-workspace deep links.** A `/repos/:projectId` link to a project in _another_ workspace the
  user belongs to silently switches them into it (project ids are globally-unique); non-members
  still get a 404. This only happens on page GET loaders — a stale-tab POST stays a hard 404.

### 3.9 Release registry & versioning (PRD §7.7)

eve has no native versioning; Eden layers one over git. A **Release = an immutable build at a merge
commit** — `{ label (v1/v2…), commit_sha, image_digest, changelog, author, created_at }`. Immutability
is inherited: git commits + content-addressed images, nothing engineered.

- The **deploy controller** (§3.1) records a Release per build and keeps the image (already retained
  for rollback). **Fast rollback** = re-point an environment/split to a prior Release's image (no
  rebuild); **git revert** = an undo PR through the normal pipeline.
- An **environment maps to one or more active Releases with weights** (the split config the ingress
  proxy §3.6 enforces). Running multiple versions live is the core product primitive — Eden does
  _not_ ship an automated A/B/experimentation engine; per-version telemetry (§3.7) is how humans judge.
- **Immutability caveat:** a Release pins repo state (config/tools/skills/instructions), **not**
  secrets/env (they live outside git). Version secret _metadata/generation_ only — never values — for
  faithful "what ran then".

## 4. Per-instance dependencies (managed)

| Dependency          | Managed implementation                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Workflow World**  | **Self-run Postgres** on the box (or a dedicated DB box), **database-per-instance** for hard data isolation. Postgres is eve's reference World; running our own is cheap and removes the Neon/cloud dependency. |
| **Sandbox backend** | gVisor (v1) / Kata-Firecracker (hardened) ephemeral containers, per §2.2.                                                                                                                                       |
| **Secrets**         | Injected env from §3.5.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Model access**    | Routed through the model gateway §3.2 (direct provider keys, no AI Gateway).                                                                                                                                    |
| **Ingress**         | Per-instance subdomain via §3.6.                                                                                                                                                                                |

## 5. Deploy pipeline (managed, on merge)

```
PR merged ──► Deploy Controller:
  1. eve build            → .eve/ + Nitro .output/
  2. docker build         → image (shared base layer)
  3. push                 → local registry on the box
  4. provision            → create instance Postgres DB, load secrets as env
  5. run                  → Nomad/Docker: start container w/ gVisor runtime
  6. release              → record Release {commit_sha, image_digest, label, changelog}
  7. route                → Caddy/Traefik subdomain + wake-proxy + weighted split config
  8. health + smoke       → mark live; keep previous Release image for fast rollback
  9. idle                 → scheduler stops container after idle timeout
```

The data plane admits multiple live Releases per environment (§3.6/§3.9), but since M5.6 the
controller enforces single-live: step 8's "mark live" also demotes the environment's other live
deployments (cutover on health — a failed deploy leaves the old version serving). Rollback ("Make
live" on a prior Release) is the same path with the retained image — seconds, no rebuild.

---

## 6. Reliability & the single-box tradeoff

Running on one box is a deliberate cost tradeoff. Honest accounting:

- **No HA in v1** — the box is a single point of failure. Acceptable for early managed customers;
  set expectations in the SLA.
- **State survives crashes.** Because durability lives in Postgres (compute ⟂ state), a box reboot
  loses only _in-flight compute_ — sessions **replay from the event log and resume**. This is a big
  win of eve's model and must be protected.
- **Protect Postgres above all.** It is the durable truth for every agent. Put it on its own
  disk/volume, enable WAL archiving, and **stream backups to object storage** (S3/B2). Ideally a
  warm standby (second cheap box or managed replica) even before full compute HA.
- **Disk is the sleeper risk.** Images + writable layers + Postgres + backups. Monitor and GC old
  images/stopped-container layers; use a shared base image.

---

## 7. Scaling path (1 → N boxes)

The architecture is designed so growth is "add a box," not "re-platform":

1. **One box, Docker API** — simplest start.
2. **One box, Nomad** — same box, better scheduling/health; drop-in.
3. **N boxes, Nomad cluster** — Nomad schedules instances across nodes; ingress/wake-proxy front the
   cluster; **Postgres moves to a dedicated DB host** (or managed) and instance DBs shard across it.
4. **Elastic / multi-region** — introduce additional `DeployTarget` implementations (a cloud target,
   K8s) _alongside_ bare metal for burst or geo — the seam already exists.

Nothing in the control plane changes across these steps; only the `DeployTarget` and where Postgres
lives.

---

## 8. Security / threat model (essentials)

- **Untrusted code runs in the data plane, never the control plane.** The gateway, controller,
  scheduler, and secrets store are never in an agent's process.
- **Model-generated code** → ephemeral gVisor/Firecracker sandbox, no host network, no ambient creds,
  egress filtered.
- **Tenant isolation** → gVisor (min) / Kata (hardened) per instance; per-instance Postgres DB;
  per-instance secret scope; network policy between containers.
- **Egress control** on instances/sandboxes to limit data exfiltration and SSRF.
- **Spend/abuse** → per-tenant token + compute caps and kill-switches at the gateway.
- **Secrets** encrypted at rest, injected at boot, never in repo or logs; assistant sees names only.

## 10. What changed vs. a cloud-VM substrate

| Concern          | Cloud (Fly-style)        | Bare-metal Docker (chosen)                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Isolation        | microVM per app (native) | gVisor per container; Kata/Firecracker via KVM when needed             |
| Scale-to-zero    | native wake-on-request   | **stop container** + Sablier/wake-proxy                                |
| Workflow World   | managed Postgres (Neon)  | **self-run Postgres**, DB-per-instance                                 |
| Orchestration    | provider API             | **Nomad** (or Docker API)                                              |
| Cost model       | pay-per-VM-second        | fixed monthly box; near-zero marginal per idle agent                   |
| HA               | multi-node by default    | **single box v1**, state survives via Postgres replay; add boxes later |
| Metering compute | provider billing API     | cgroup / `docker stats` / Nomad metrics                                |

Everything above the substrate — control/data-plane split, tenancy unit, compute⟂state, the model
gateway, metering chokepoints, and the `DeployTarget` seam — is **unchanged**. That's the payoff of
putting the substrate behind an interface.

## 11. Risks & spikes to de-risk first

1. **Sandbox isolation** for untrusted model code on a shared kernel — validate gVisor overhead vs.
   Firecracker-via-`firecracker-containerd`; pick the v1 line.
2. **Wake-on-request latency** — measure cold-start (container start + Nitro boot + Workflow replay);
   decide idle-timeout and whether to keep a small warm pool.
3. **Postgres blast radius / backup-restore drill** — prove we can restore all instance DBs from
   object storage; decide on a warm standby before real customers.
4. **Density ceiling** — find the real limit (disk, file descriptors, PIDs, Postgres connections) on
   the target box before we promise capacity.
5. **`eve build` headless** — confirm build/init run non-interactively in the controller.
6. **OTel span fidelity for observability** — confirm eve's AI-SDK spans include full tool
   input/output (not just names/timing); if not, supplement from the Workflow event log. Decide the
   normalized runs schema before building the UI.
7. **Authenticated OTLP ingest for BYO** — design the public OTLP receiver + per-instance ingest
   tokens + rate limiting so self-hosted instances can ship runs back without leaking cross-tenant.
